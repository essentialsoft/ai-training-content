## Description
This course is your ultimate guide to building Autonomous AI Agents with AutoGen & MCP –End-to-End Agentic AI Workflows with 6 Agents for Real-World Automation. Even if you're new to this space, we start from the absolute basics—no prior knowledge of agent frameworks is required.

You’ll start by mastering the core foundations – Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents, Multi-Agents, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which serves as the backbone for agent-to-tool communication. Next, you’ll learn how to engineer contexts and craft prompts that unlock the true potential of your AI agents.

## What you'll learn
1. Fundamentals of LLMs, AI Agents, MCP, and Multi-Agent Systems
2. Build workflows and reusable agents with the AutoGen Framework
3. Develop specialized agents for bug analysis, browser automation, API testing, and data analysis
4. Design autonomous, collaborative agents with context engineering and human-in-loop strategies
5. Apply Agent Factory patterns and real-world MCP configurations
