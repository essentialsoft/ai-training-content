## Module Overview
Master prompt engineering—the practice of designing prompts that steer LLMs toward accurate, reliable outputs. This module curates a hands-on Udemy bootcamp, a community guide, and a concise Google Cloud primer. You’ll learn patterns, context strategies, and evaluation techniques, then map them to ESI’s AI-powered SDLC for developers, QA, and product roles from ideation through release.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify core prompt engineering concepts and place them within ESI’s development workflow.
- Apply structured patterns with context, constraints, and examples to common development tasks.
- Evaluate prompt quality using test harnesses and metrics, and iterate to improve reliability.
- Integrate prompts into toolchains (e.g., Copilot, SDKs) with safety checks and documentation.
- Troubleshoot hallucinations, ambiguity, and bias using systematic experiments and reusable recipes.
