# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

**Difficulty** :  Intermediate

**Topics** : RAG, AI Frameworks, AI Tools, AI in Software Development, Fundamentals, Workflow, Prompt Engineering, Multimodal



## Module Overview
Learn to design, build, and evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for real products. Combine practical patterns with hands-on labs using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith, plus a structured Pluralsight path. Map RAG to ESI’s AI-powered cycle—requirements, prototyping, evaluation, and deployment—to deliver source-grounded assistants that perform reliably in production.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain RAG architecture and when to use it in the software lifecycle.
- Build end-to-end RAG pipelines with LangChain and LangGraph using vector databases.
- Evaluate retrieval and generation quality with LangSmith tracing and metrics.
- Optimize chunking, indexing, query strategies, and hybrid retrieval for accuracy and cost.
- Troubleshoot and deploy production RAG services aligned with ESI workflows.
