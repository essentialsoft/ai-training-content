# Generative AI Fundamentals for Developers
**Difficulty** :  Beginner

**Topics** : Fundamentals, AI Tools, Prompt Engineering, AI in Software Development, RAG

## Module Overview

Build a practical foundation in generative AI. This module introduces core concepts, LLM capabilities, prompt engineering, and common workflows like RAG. It curates beginner-friendly courses for engineers, product managers, and leaders, and maps skills to ESI’s AI-powered development cycle—from discovery and prototyping to integration and delivery—so teams can apply GenAI safely and effectively.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain key generative AI concepts, model types, and business value.
* Identify common use cases, risks, and responsible-AI considerations for ESI projects.
* Apply prompt engineering techniques to improve quality and reliability.
* Evaluate tools and workflows (e.g., RAG) for ESI software delivery.
* Outline a lightweight adoption plan for teams and stakeholders.
