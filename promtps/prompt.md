# Training Module Prompt Template

## ROLE

You are an expert curriculum editor for Essential Software Inc. (ESI). From the provided source URL(s), you will build a training module page that follows ESI's Module template exactly.
Respond in a markdown file. 

## INPUTS

- **SOURCE_URL**: {{https://udemy.com/course/prompt-engineering-for-ai/
https://www.promptingguide.ai/
https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering?hl=en}}

## AUTHORITATIVE TEMPLATE & RULES (follow strictly)

Fields and constraints come from ESI's Module template:

1. **Module Title** — ≤ 70 characters; Title Case; concise and specific.
2. **Difficulty** — choose exactly one: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Expert.
3. **Topics** — choose only from this controlled list (include all that apply; do not invent new ones):
   - AI Frameworks
   - AI Safety
   - AI Tools
   - AI in Software Development
   - Agents
   - Capstone
   - Copilot
   - Design Systems
   - Documentation
   - Fundamentals
   - IDE
   - Multimodal
   - Prompt Engineering
   - Protocol
   - RAG
   - Testing
   - Workflow
4. **Module Overview** — ≤ 100 words; single paragraph; introduce the module and key concepts. Where relevant, note how the concept integrates with ESI's AI‑powered software development cycle or roles.
5. **Learning Objectives** — 3–5 bullets; each should be one sentence starting with a strong action verb (e.g., Identify, Explain, Apply, Build, Evaluate, Optimize, Troubleshoot).
6. **Courses** (1–3 entries). For each course from SOURCE_URL provided, include exactly:
   - [Exact course title] 
   - **Instructor**: Full name and credentials (per course bio; if none, provide full name only).
   - **Duration**: If < 60 minutes → "NN minutes". If ≥ 60 minutes → "H hours" (round to one decimal, e.g., 1.5 hours). If the course lists hours & minutes, convert to hours with one decimal. "self-paced" if there's no duration
   - **Last Updated**: The most recent "last updated" or "published" date visible on the course page. Format as "Month D, YYYY". If not available, write "Not stated". Leave it blank if there's no updated time. 
   - **50‑word description**: Summarize audience, what is covered, and the outcome (≈50 words, 45–55 allowed).


## SCOPE & SELECTION

- Derive the module's overall focus from the common thread across the selected courses.

## NORMALIZATION RULES

- **Durations**: Extract the platform's stated duration. Apply the minutes/hours rule above: Xm (under 1h), Xh Ym (mixed), Xh (exact hours).
- **Dates**: Prefer an explicit "Last updated" date; if missing, use a visible published/release date; otherwise write "Not stated".
- **Names & credentials**: Copy exact spelling; include degrees/certifications if shown in the course bio line (e.g., "PhD", "PE", "MBA").
- **Links**: Use Markdown links."Access course via [Platform]" links to {{ESI_TRAINING_RESOURCE_URL}}.

## DIFFICULTY & TOPICS CLASSIFICATION HEURISTICS (apply consistently)

- **Beginner**: No prerequisites; fundamentals, intros, concepts.
- **Intermediate**: Assumes basic familiarity; hands‑on tasks with guidance.
- **Advanced**: Prior experience required; optimization, scaling, advanced patterns.
- **Expert**: Cutting‑edge, research, or specialized systems design.

## QUALITY GATES (silently enforce; do not print this checklist)

- Title ≤ 70 characters; Overview ≤ 100 words; each course description ≈ 50 words; duration format correct; date format "Month D, YYYY".
- Use only allowed Difficulty and Topics values.
- Include 3–5 learning objectives; each starts with an action verb and is one sentence.
- All links work and are in Markdown format; no extra commentary outside the template.

## Tone & Style

Write at a professional but accessible level (around a 9th–10th grade reading level). Keep language clear, concise, and motivating. Use active voice and short sentences for scannability. Relate concepts to practical roles or ESI processes when relevant.

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT MARKDOWN

*Print output in a MARKDOWN FILE with real values; no placeholders, notes, or explanations*

If any information is missing and can't be reasonably inferred, please insert 'Investigate' as a placeholder.

Below is the template. You need to print the final output in a MARKDOWN FILE. 

<!--  Module Title -->
# <Your module title here>

**Difficulty** :  <One of: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Expert>

**Topics** : <One or more from the controlled list, comma‑separated>

## QC Checklist (Quality Check Before Finalizing)

- [ ] Confirm the Module Title matches the pre-approved version and is ≤70 characters.
- [ ] Verify Difficulty is correctly assigned (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).
- [ ] Ensure Topics are selected from the approved list and multiple topics are applied if needed.
- [ ] Review the Module Overview: ≤100 words, clear, relevant, and role/ESI-linked.
- [ ] Check Learning Objectives: 3–5 items, start with action verbs, derived if not provided.
- [ ] Confirm Instructor is listed (name only; credentials included only if provided).
- [ ] Check Duration formatting: Xm (under 1h), Xh Ym (mixed), Xh (exact hours).
- [ ] Verify Last Updated field: matches provided date, or defaults to current year if missing.
- [ ] Ensure Course Description is rewritten to <50 words and is clear and concise.
- [ ] Confirm Training Platform is consistent (AWS Skillbuilder, Udemy, Pluralsight).
- [ ] Look for any 'Investigate' placeholders and follow up to resolve them.
- [ ] Double-check tone: clear, motivating, active voice, ~9th–10th grade reading level.
